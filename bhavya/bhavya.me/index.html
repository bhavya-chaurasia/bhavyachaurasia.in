                        "content": "\nMEMS is the name of Mahindra University's online services web application.\n\nIntroducing MEMS (Mahindra University Management System), an online tool for managing student organizations, events, and clubs at universities. MEMS seeks to close the communication gap amongst clubs and students by providing an environment for simple communication and timely notifications of future events in the lack of a comprehensive event management website on the market. The site allows clubs to find volunteers and update all pertinent data, decreasing the need for paper work and saving time and resources. MEMS, in contrast to certain other event management solutions, aims to streamline the event flow and link students with groups for synchronous communication..\n\n## SCOPE\n\nThe website will act as a platform from where we can create events, and notifications of the upcoming event can book tickets (Can show that they are interested in the event), and the website will contain the event galley as well. We can use this website to promote and manage events. The website will contain all the information about the clubs of the university and details about their past and present events and the list of current heads.![](images/sg01-UxND.png)\n\n## Features\n\n- **Event Creation:**  Club heads to be able to create events which includes\n\n- **Communication:** Organizers to be able to send mails to interested students (via mails)\n\n- **Manage Past Events:** Creating event gallery completed events(gives glimpses of recently concluded events) and uploading pictures and video links of events ",
